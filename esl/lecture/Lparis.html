    <h4>Lecture - History: Vikings and the raids on Paris</h4>
       
	  <p>
  The Viking "invasions of Paris" were a series of real and significant 
  events during the 9th century. The city of Paris, then much smaller
  and centered on the Île de la Cité (an island in the River Seine),
  was attacked several times by Viking raiders coming from Scandinavia. 
  Here's a historical account of the most notable invasions:</p><br>
<br><hr>

<h4>Overview of Viking Invasions of Paris:</h4>

 <b>1. First Viking Raid on Paris – 845 AD
 <br> Viking Leader:<br></b>

<p>
<b>"Reginherus"(possibly Ragnar Lothbrok according to legend, though
 not confirmed by all historians)</b><br>
Force Size: Approximately 120 ships and 5,000 men</p>

<p><b>"Ruler of West Francia"(French - which included Paris):<Br>
<b>"Charles the Bald", grandson of Charlemagne.</b></p><p>

<b>Ruler of Paris itself:</b><br>
 The city was under the protection of <b>Charles the Bald</b>, but it did not
 have an independent ruler at the time. The counts of Paris held 
 authority.</p>
<p><b>What Happened:</b><br>

* The Vikings sailed up the Seine River and reached Paris.
* They sacked the city after defeating the Frankish forces.
* Charles the Bald **paid a ransom of 7,000 livres of silver** 
to make them leave—a huge sum at the time.
</p>
<p><b>Impact:<b><br>

 This was the first major Viking attack on Paris and showed the 
 weakness of the Carolingian rulers.
 It set a precedent for future raids and ransom payments.
</p><hr><p><b>2. Second Major Siege of Paris – 885–886 AD:</b><br>

<b>Dates:</b><br>
 Began in November 885 and ended in October 886
<br>
<b>Viking Leaders:</b><br>
Sigfred, Sinric, and later Rollo (who would become the first 
Duke of Normandy).
<br>
<b>Force Size:</b><br> 
Around 300–700 ships and 30,000–40,000 men (according to medieval sources; 
likely exaggerated)
<br>
<b>Defender of Paris:</b><br>
Count Odo (later King Odo of France), a heroic figure in the 
defense.</p>
<p><b>King of West Francia(french):<br>
Charles the Fat (a great-grandson of Charlemagne)</b><br>

<b>What Happened:</b><br>

 Vikings demanded passage through Paris to raid Burgundy. 
 Odo refused.
 Vikings laid siege to Paris, focusing on attacking the fortified 
 bridges and towers.
 Odo held out for months, leading a fierce defense from the Île 
 de la Cité.
 Charles the Fat eventually arrived with an imperial army—not to 
 fight, but to negotiate.
 He paid the Vikings off again and allowed them to sail further 
 up the Seine.
</p><p><br>
<b>Impact:</b><br>
 Odo’s defense won him great acclaim and the kingship in 888 
 after Charles the Fat's death.
The siege highlighted the decline of Carolingian power and the 
rise of local leaders.
</p><hr><p>
 <b> What Was Paris Like Then?</b>

Not the large capital we know today.
Centered around the Île de la Cité (today where Notre-Dame Cathedral is).
Fortified with two wooden bridges linking to the banks and stone 
towers guarding the city.
The Frankish kings struggled to control powerful nobles and Viking
 raids.
</p><hr>
<p>
<b>Aftermath and Legacy:</b><br>

 Viking raids on Paris showed the fragmentation of the Carolingian 
 Empire.
The defense by Count Odo symbolized the shift of power from kings 
to local lords.
 In 911, Viking leader Rollo was granted Normandy in the Treaty 
 of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, becoming a vassal to the French king — 
 this ended the worst Viking raids on Paris.</p>
